/**
 * Performance scorecards (Module C3, v2).
 *
 * Every person except the workspace Owner gets one scorecard a month, scored
 * 0-100 from records the system already holds - nobody types a number in. It
 * is built from "pillars" (delivery, quality, ...), each scored on its own and
 * then blended by weight. The manager's 1-5 rating is the only human input,
 * and it is a fixed share of the overall.
 *
 * Two shapes of card:
 *   employee - how well their own work went
 *   manager  - their own work, plus how their team and projects went
 * Anyone with the Manager role, or anyone else with direct reports, gets the
 * manager card.
 *
 * Fairness rules that run through all of it:
 *   - A pillar with too little evidence is "not enough data" and drops out;
 *     its weight is shared across the pillars that do have data. It never
 *     counts as zero.
 *   - Weekly offs, company holidays and approved leave are not working days,
 *     so they can never count against anyone.
 *   - A month in progress is scored up to today. Work not yet due is left
 *     out rather than counted as missed.
 *
 * Every pillar carries its raw inputs and the specific records that pulled it
 * down ("drivers"), so a score can always be explained line by line.
