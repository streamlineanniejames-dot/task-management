 * Keeps the client register and the pipeline table in step.
 *
 * The Clients page writes to client_accounts, but projects, invoices,
 * proposals and recurring invoices all carry a foreign key to clients(id) —
 * 34 joins across 16 files, including the invoicing and GST paths. Rather than
 * re-point all of that, every account gets a matching row in `clients`, linked
 * by client_account_id, so existing queries keep working untouched.
 *
 * That row is created with NO stage, which is what keeps it off the CRM board:
 * the board selects by stage, so a stage-less row never appears on it. A client
 * on the register is not an opportunity in the funnel.
