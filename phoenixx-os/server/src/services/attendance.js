/**
 * Module C - the working day.
 *
 * Attendance decides pay and performance scores, so the two things it must
 * never get wrong are *when* the day was and *who* said so. Both are settled
 * here rather than in the routes:
 *
 *  - **When.** A working day is a day on the workspace calendar, and a shift
 *    starts at a workspace-local wall clock. The server is not in the office
 *    and neither is UTC, so every comparison goes through the tenant timezone.
 *  - **Who.** The employee stamps nothing. Check-in and check-out times are
 *    taken from the server clock at the moment the button is pressed, and the
 *    only other way a time can move is an HR correction, which is logged.
 *
 * The schedule is resolved per employee with a workspace fallback, and it is
 * *snapshotted onto the attendance row* at check-in - HR changing someone's
 * hours in October must not rewrite whether they were late in September.
